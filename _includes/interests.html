			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Deep learning</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm working through several online classes, and swap articles with collegues.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>RC Planes and Boats</b>. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality
          devices. I like to modify existing kits to improve speed, and add instrumentation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Mountaineering</b>. I live in the Pacific Northwest, home of some of the greatest mountains and trails in the country. I enjoy spending weekends
          on scrambles and getting lost in the woods.
